##  Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: HTML + CSS + Bootstrap (simple UI)
- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Database**: Amazon RDS (MySQL)
- **Compute**: Amazon EC2 (App Server with Auto Scaling)
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer (HTTPS via ACM)
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 (future use: static/media files)
- **IAM Roles & Security Groups**: Least privilege principle followed
- **SSH & WinSCP**: For secure server access and app uploads
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Domain & SSL**: Optional Cloudflare + AWS ACM for HTTPS
